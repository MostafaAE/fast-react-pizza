# Fast React Pizza

A React Project to practice (React Router data loading, Redux, Redux Toolkit, thunks, Tailwind CSS).
Fast React Pizza is a user-friendly Pizza Ordering App that allows customers to create their orders seamlessly. Users can personalize their pizza selections, adjust quantities, and remove items from their cart. The app also facilitates order placement by collecting customer information and generating a receipt.

During this project, I did:
- Developed a highly interactive and responsive front-end using React.js, complemented by React Router for seamless navigation, focused on delivering a responsive and visually appealing user interface using Tailwind CSS.
- Employed Redux for effective state management, ensuring real-time updates and efficient data handling.
- Enabled user-friendly order customization with real-time quantity adjustments and item removal.
- Designed a precise and user-friendly order placement process, and implemented an automated receipt generation for order summaries.
